# Input Prompt

I have a simple Python package and I install it with like pip install dashi or whatever and inside this Python package I have like 10 functions. Can one of those 10 functions use other functions within the package or it cannot?

# Anthropic Response

# Yes, absolutely! Functions within your package can definitely call each other.

This is actually very common and encouraged for code organization. Here's how it works:

## Example Package Structure

```
dashi/
├── __init__.py
└── utils.py
```

## Example Code

**utils.py:**
```python
def helper_function(x):
    """A helper function"""
    return x * 2

def main_function(x):
    """This function uses helper_function"""
    result = helper_function(x)
    return result + 10

def another_function(x):
    """This also uses helper_function"""
    return helper_function(x) + 5
```

**__init__.py:**
```python
from .utils import helper_function, main_function, another_function

# Or import everything
# from .utils import *
```

## Usage After Installation

```python
import dashi

result = dashi.main_function(5)  # This will work fine!
# Internally, main_function calls helper_function
```

## Key Points:

- ✅ Functions in the same module can call each other directly
- ✅ Functions in different modules within your package can import and use each other
- ✅ You can organize code hierarchically with helper/utility functions
- ✅ This works whether installed via pip or imported locally

This is standard practice - most packages have internal functions that support the public-facing API!
