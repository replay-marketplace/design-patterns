I want to have a program that searches all Python files and extracts for all modules, Python modules, Python libraries that were imported. Tell me about the types of things that this code would need to search for. For example, like which keywords, obviously the word import, but are there some other ways to import stuff? Make a list of stuff that it should search for in terms of strings. Thanks.
