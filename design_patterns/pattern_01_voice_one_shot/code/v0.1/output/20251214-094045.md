write a Python program that writes code by doing it in three stages. The user provides a goal for what piece of software to create in a form of a text or MD file. And our program has three stages architecture, implementation, and then coding. Let's talk about the architecture stage first. For the architecture stage, the program takes the goal provided by the user and thinks about what architectural choices will be made. To make the architectural choices, it first makes a list of topics on which we have to make a decision. For each topic, it lists the decisions to be made. Then it saves those in a file so the user can review. Then it goes ahead and makes the choices for each topic architecturally and then saves that in another file showing the user which architectural decisions have been chosen. Those architectural decisions are then passed to the implementation stage. Now in the implementation stage, the program looks at the architectural decisions and then starts planning the implementation. The implementation is generated by taking the ideas for the architecture and then creating directory structures based on the division of software blocks required to implement it. The implementation stage outputs a file with directory structure and it outputs a file with a list of software blocks that the implementation breaks down into. Each software block should be one directory. Those files are then given to the coding stage. Now the coder
