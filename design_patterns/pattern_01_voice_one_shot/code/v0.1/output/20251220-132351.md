I want to buy a CPU that can run code. It doesn't need to be very performant CPU, but it needs to be very cheap because I want to buy a very large volume. I want to install a very lightweight Linux on it and then run a lot of unit tests for Python and various libraries. Make a list of CPUs, their price, and then give them a score for performance. Make a table. So each row in the table is the name of the CPU and then in the columns assign a performance number from 1 to 5, 5 being top performance, 1 being lowest performance. And then in another column put the price of the CPU and then in another column any notes you want to put. Make a table, thanks.
