# Anthropic Response

# GitHub Actions Workflow File

## Example File

```yaml
name: CI

# Triggers
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:  # Allows manual trigger

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
    
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build
```

## File Name and Location

**File name:** `ci.yml` (or `ci.yaml`)

**Full path:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

## Key Points:

- **Extension:** `.yml` or `.yaml` (both work)
- **Directory:** Must be in `.github/workflows/` folder
- **Common names:** 
  - `ci.yml`
  - `main.yml`
  - `build.yml`
  - `test.yml`

You can name it anything you want, but it **must**:
1. Be in `.github/workflows/` directory
2. Have a `.yml` or `.yaml` extension

The example above triggers on pushes to main/develop branches and on pull requests!
