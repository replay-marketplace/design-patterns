Okay, so we're going to be writing a program in Python that I will use as a coding agent or a software that codes using LLM agents. I want you to help me make a list of functions that I will use to create this software that uses agents to generate code. Here are a few categories of functions, and for each category I want you to enumerate a few functions and their signatures, like input arguments and return value, so that we can work towards a complete list of functions. First category is agent chat, so a function in that category would be something like input argument is a text string, and inside the function it sends that text as prompt to the agent and then returns text string, which is the answer of the agent. Another function within the agent category would be receives two text strings, one is a prompt, the other one is system settings, and then returns the answer from the agent. A second category is string processing, so things like append to a string, search for a word within a string and then delete it, or search for a word within a string and then replace it, or format a certain string, and a few functions like that. Then another category is file processing, like one function within that category would be receive text as input as well as a directory and a file name, and then save that text as file contents into the file. Another function would be receive JSON with a list of files and file names and path and file contents, and then save that into a directory. A fourth category would be category of JSON processing, so within JSON processing it could be a function receives a path to a directory and reads all the files within that directory in all of its recursive directories, and then returns a JSON with those files. List more ideas for categories. Make a big list.
