# Input Prompt

I want to buy a CPU that can run code. It doesn't need to be very performant CPU, but it needs to be very cheap because I want to buy a very large volume. I want to install a very lightweight Linux on it and then run a lot of unit tests for Python and various libraries. Make a list of CPUs, their price, and then give them a score for performance. Make a table. So each row in the table is the name of the CPU and then in the columns assign a performance number from 1 to 5, 5 being top performance, 1 being lowest performance. And then in another column put the price of the CPU and then in another column any notes you want to put. Make a table, thanks.

# Anthropic Response

# Budget CPUs for Python Unit Testing

| CPU Model | Performance Score (1-5) | Approximate Price (USD) | Notes |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------------|-------|
| **Intel Celeron N4020** | 2 | $42-50 | Dual-core, 1.1-2.8 GHz, very low power (6W TDP), good for basic tasks |
| **Intel Celeron J4125** | 2.5 | $90-110 | Quad-core, 2.0-2.7 GHz, better multi-threading for parallel tests |
| **AMD Athlon 3000G** | 3 | $75-95 | Dual-core/4-thread, 3.5 GHz, includes integrated graphics, AM4 socket |
| **Intel Pentium Gold G6400** | 3 | $65-85 | Dual-core/4-thread, 4.0 GHz, good single-thread performance |
| **Intel Core i3-10100F** | 4 | $75-95 | Quad-core/8-thread, 3.6-4.3 GHz, no iGPU (need separate GPU), excellent value |
| **AMD Ryzen 3 4100** | 4 | $80-100 | Quad-core/8-thread, 3.8-4.0 GHz, AM4 socket, efficient |
| **Intel Core i3-12100F** | 4.5 | $95-115 | Quad-core/8-thread, 3.3-4.3 GHz, newer architecture, great performance/$ |
| **Raspberry Pi CM4** | 1.5 | $25-45 | Quad-core ARM, 1.5 GHz, extremely low cost, complete solution option |

## Key Recommendations:

**Best Ultra-Budget Option:** **Intel Celeron N4020** - If you're running tests sequentially and want absolute minimum cost

**Best Value Overall:** **Intel Core i3-10100F** or **AMD Ryzen 3 4100** - Best balance of cost vs. parallel test execution capability

**For High Volume Deployment:** Consider **Intel Celeron J4125** - Good enough for unit tests, quad-core helps with parallel execution

## Important Considerations:
- **Don't forget additional costs**: Motherboard, RAM, storage, power supply
- **Consider SBCs**: Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB) or similar ARM boards might be more cost-effective for complete systems (~$75 complete)
- **Containerization**: You might get better economics running these tests in cloud containers or using existing hardware more efficiently
- **Parallel execution**: More cores = faster test suite completion with pytest-xdist or similar tools

Would you like recommendations for complete system builds or alternative approaches?
