I want to make a really simple game in Python that, after a few seconds, creates a little flower on the screen, maybe in a browser, and you have to click on it with your mouse, and then it disappears, and then you get a point. And it just keeps going, creating these flowers, and you have to click on them to cancel them. Make a prompt that will tell an agent how to code that little app for a browser.
