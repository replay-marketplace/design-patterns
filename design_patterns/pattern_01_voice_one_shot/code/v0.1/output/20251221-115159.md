Give me some examples of super simple programs that I can create in Python, but I want to force to split them across two Python modules so that I can test the module structure and make sure there's some APIs in between that I can test. I want the applications to be something that you can test with code and that the human can easily see if it's working or not. Something very simple, the inputs are short, like maybe some number multiplication or addition or something, sorting of very small arrays. Something very easy to test, but it's split across two modules and you can print in between data to see if it's working or not.
