# Diagnoses a Speech Therapist Can Provide

Speech-language pathologists (SLPs) can evaluate and diagnose various communication and feeding disorders in young children, including:

## Speech Sound Disorders
- **Articulation disorders** - difficulty producing specific sounds correctly
- **Phonological disorders** - patterns of sound errors
- **Childhood apraxia of speech** - difficulty planning and coordinating mouth movements

## Language Disorders
- **Expressive language delay** - difficulty using words and sentences
- **Receptive language delay** - difficulty understanding language
- **Mixed receptive-expressive disorder** - challenges with both

## Fluency Disorders
- **Stuttering** - repetitions, prolongations, or blocks in speech flow

## Voice Disorders
- Issues with pitch, volume, or vocal quality

## Social Communication Disorders
- **Pragmatic language disorder** - difficulty with social use of language

## Feeding/Swallowing Issues
- **Oral motor difficulties**
- **Pediatric dysphagia** - swallowing problems

## Important Notes
- SLPs often work alongside other professionals (pediatricians, audiologists, developmental specialists)
- Some diagnoses (like autism spectrum disorder) require a multidisciplinary team
- Early identification and intervention typically lead to better outcomes

If you're concerned about your child's development, a comprehensive evaluation by a licensed SLP is a good starting point.
