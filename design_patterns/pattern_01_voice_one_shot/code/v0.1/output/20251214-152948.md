# Input Prompt

What are some illegal things that you cannot do in countries but you would be allowed to do in those international waters on a boat? Are there some things and what would be the categories of those things? Make a list, I'm really curious.

# Things Legal in International Waters But Illegal in Most Countries

International waters (generally beyond 12-24 nautical miles from shore) have interesting legal gray zones:

## Actually Legal/Unregulated:

**Maritime Activities:**
- Operating unlicensed radio/TV broadcasts (historic "pirate radio" stations)
- Some commercial fishing without national licenses (though regional treaties often apply)
- Operating certain gambling establishments (though flag state laws may apply)

**Financial/Commercial:**
- Avoiding certain taxes (though your citizenship may still obligate you)
- Hosting servers with less restrictive content policies

## Common Misconceptions:

**NOT actually legal:**
- **Serious crimes** - Murder, assault, theft remain illegal under:
  - Your ship's flag state laws
  - Universal jurisdiction for serious crimes
  - Your citizenship's laws
- **Drug trafficking** - International treaties apply
- **Environmental dumping** - MARPOL conventions regulate this
- **Weapons trafficking** - International laws apply

## The Reality:

You're subject to:
1. **Flag state law** (country where vessel is registered)
2. **Your citizenship laws** (many countries claim jurisdiction over their citizens anywhere)
3. **International treaties** your country has signed
4. **Port state control** when you dock

The "lawless seas" concept is largely mythological. Most serious activities remain illegal through overlapping jurisdictions.
