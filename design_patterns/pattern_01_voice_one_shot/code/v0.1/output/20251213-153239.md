# Input Prompt

I want to make a really simple game in Python that, after a few seconds, creates a little flower on the screen, maybe in a browser, and you have to click on it with your mouse, and then it disappears, and then you get a point. And it just keeps going, creating these flowers, and you have to click on them to cancel them. Make a prompt that will tell an agent how to code that little app for a browser.

# Prompt for Creating a Flower Clicking Game

Create a simple browser-based game with the following specifications:

## Game Mechanics
- Flowers appear randomly on the screen at intervals (every 2-3 seconds)
- Each flower appears at a random position on the screen
- When a player clicks on a flower, it disappears and the score increases by 1
- The game runs continuously, spawning new flowers indefinitely
- Display the current score prominently on the screen

## Technical Requirements
- Use Python with a web framework (Flask or similar) to serve the game
- Create an HTML page with embedded CSS and JavaScript for the game interface
- The flower can be a simple emoji (🌸) or a CSS-styled element
- Make flowers clickable and responsive
- Ensure flowers don't spawn too close to screen edges
- Keep the code simple and easy to understand

## Visual Design
- Clean, minimal interface
- Score counter at the top of the page
- Flowers should be clearly visible (reasonable size, around 40-60px)
- Optional: Add a subtle animation or transition when flowers appear/disappear

## File Structure
Create a single Python file that:
1. Sets up a Flask server
2. Serves an HTML page containing all CSS and JavaScript inline
3. Runs on localhost (default port 5000)

Keep the entire implementation under 100 lines of code if possible. Prioritize simplicity and functionality over advanced features.
