# High-End PCB Printing Machine Recommendations

For high-end PCB printing/manufacturing, here are the top options depending on your specific needs:

## **For Solder Paste Printing (Most Common "PCB Printing")**

### **Ekra X5** or **Ekra Xprt3**
- Industry-leading precision
- Automated optical alignment
- Price: $150,000 - $300,000+
- Best for high-volume production

### **DEK Horizon Series** (ASM Assembly Systems)
- Exceptional repeatability (±15μm)
- Advanced vision systems
- Price: $200,000 - $400,000+

## **For Direct PCB Manufacturing (Prototyping)**

### **LPKF ProtoLaser S4**
- Laser direct structuring
- No chemicals needed
- Rapid prototyping
- Price: $150,000 - $250,000

### **Voltera NOVA**
- Desktop solution (more affordable high-end)
- Conductive ink printing
- Price: ~$50,000
- Good for R&D labs

## **For Legend/Solder Mask Printing**

### **Atma AT-80PLC**
- Screen printing system
- High precision registration
- Price: $80,000 - $150,000

## **Key Questions to Consider:**
1. What's your production volume?
2. What PCB complexity (layer count, finest pitch)?
3. Is this for prototyping or production?
4. What's your budget range?

Would you like detailed specifications on any of these, or do you need recommendations for a different aspect of PCB manufacturing?
