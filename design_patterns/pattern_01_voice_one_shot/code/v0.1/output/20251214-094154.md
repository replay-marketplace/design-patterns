Create a prompt that we're going to give to a coding LLM agent to generate a software tool called Arc Impul Code. I want you to create a prompt to generate this. The input to the program is a goal to be generated, provided by a user, and it's a really short text file. I want you to create a prompt describing how to create the architectural implementation and coding stages. Each stage should receive input from the previous stage, and then do its own work and thinking by talking to the Anthropic API.
