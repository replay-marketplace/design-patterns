People with exceptional analytical abilities tend to ask AI agents questions that are:

## **Probing AI Limitations**
- "What are the structural reasons you can't verify your own reasoning chains?"
- "How would you design a test to detect your own hallucinations?"
- "What's the difference between your pattern matching and actual causal understanding?"

## **Meta-Level Reasoning**
- "What assumptions am I making in this question that might be constraining the solution space?"
- "How would this problem transform if we changed the underlying axioms?"
- "What am I not asking that would reframe this entirely?"

## **Novel Connections**
- "What non-obvious isomorphisms exist between [obscure field A] and [unrelated field B]?"
- "How might quantum coherence principles apply to economic game theory?"
- "What would a category theory approach reveal about this social problem?"

## **Intellectual Efficiency**
- "What's the minimal sufficient literature to understand [complex topic] deeply?"
- "What are the cruxes of disagreement between [competing theories]?"
- "Which of my assumptions here has the highest leverage if wrong?"

## **Creative Exploration**
- "Generate a framework I haven't considered for..."
- "What would be a genuinely surprising approach to..."
- "Help me steelman the position I most disagree with"

## **Reality Testing**
- "Where is my reasoning most likely to fail?"
- "What evidence would falsify my current model?"
- "What do experts know that's not in your training data?"

The pattern: **precision, self-awareness, and comfort with uncertainty.**
